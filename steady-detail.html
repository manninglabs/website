            <h2>CHALLENGE</h2>
            <p>Steady Calendar is a personal project of Manning Labs. Our team members felt the need to find a good habit tracker tool to keep track of our goals. Some of the habit trackers out there were quite good. Although most were complicated or didn't look inspiring enough. That’s how the idea of creating Steady Calendar came around. The main goal of the design was the simplicity and ease of use of the software. We wanted to create something very simple, with no distractions, that would look beautiful and inspire users to form good habits on a visual and psychological level.</p>

            <h2>OUR APPROACH</h2>
            <p>We gave ourselves a deadline - one month - to create a finished product. We started with simply <strong>brainstorming</strong> ideas and eventually  narrowed it down to a few qualities that would characterize our habit tracker best.</p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-brainstorming@2x.png" class="steady-img-brainstorming" alt="steady-brainstorming" />
            </p>
            <p>Then we did extensive <strong>research</strong> of the competition as well as the psychology behind forming good habits. The results were extremely interesting and useful.</p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-research@2x.png" class="steady-img-research" alt="steady-research" />
            </p>
            <p>After all the necessary research was conducted we proceded to creating <strong>brand identity</strong> for Steady Calendar. First and foremost the app needed a logo. We went through a long process of <strong>logo design</strong> and considered numerous iterations.</p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-logo-design@2x.png" class="steady-img-logo-design" alt="steady-logo-design" />
            </p>
            <p>The <strong>final logo</strong> has a minimalistic, simple and modern feel. It is reminiscent of a mark one uses to color off a day in a calendar. The logo scales well and looks legible
            in various sizes. The main <strong>brand color</strong> was put in place too.</p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-final-logo@2x.png" class="steady-img-final-logo" alt="steady-final-logo" />
            </p>
            <p>After careful consideration the choice of the <strong>main fonts</strong> fell on a combination of Muli Light and Quicksand. Both of these choices are meant to align with the modern and clean look of the app. The circular letter shapes are serve a purpose of reminding a user of circular shapes that are an important branding element.</p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-font-1@2x.png" class="steady-img-fonts" alt="steady-fonts"><br class="steady-br-fonts" />
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-font-2@2x.png" class="steady-img-fonts steady-img-font-lighter" alt="steady-fonts" />
            </p>
            <p>After the font choice was finalized, we started working on the user experience of Steady Calendar.Our team started with <strong>ideation</strong>. Every team member, sketched whatever features they thought our habit tracker would benefit from.</p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-ideation@2x.png" class="steady-img-ideation-desktop" alt="steady-ideation-desktop" />
            </p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/ideation-mobile@2x.png" class="steady-img-ideation-mobile" alt="steady-ideation-mobile" />
            </p>
            <p>Since the main goal for our app was the simplicity of use, we narrowed down the features to a bare minimum. The final <strong>wireframes</strong> reflected the very simple UI we had in mind </p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-wireframes-1@2x.png" class="steady-img-wireframes-desktop-1" alt="steady-wireframes-desktop" />
            </p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/wireframes-1-mobile@2x.png" class="steady-img-wireframes-mobile-1" alt="steady-wireframes-desktop" />
            </p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/wireframes-2-mobile@2x.png" class="steady-img-wireframes-mobile-1" alt="steady-wireframes-desktop" />
            </p>
            <p class="img-center">
                <img src="assets-steady/steady-wireframes-2@2x.png" class="steady-img-wireframes-2" alt="steady-wireframes-desktop" />
            </p>
            <p>Now it was time to move on to the actual <strong>design</strong> of the app. At that stage all our previously conducted extensive research of human psychology, color psychology and habit forming psychology paid off. Before coming up with the final design, we went through numerous <strong>iterations</strong> and careful <strong>testing</strong> of the prototype with potential users.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Now that the user experience and the flow of the app was more or less clear to us, we started finalizing the final touches of Steady Calendar’s look and feel. Having analyzed the results of our research in the area of motivational psychology, we realized that people are often motivated by visual triggers. That was the reason why we decided to use various <strong>motivational backgrounds</strong> in the app. </p>

            </p>
            <p>We also found our that different <strong>colors</strong> evoke different emotions and reactions in people. That is the reason why we wanted to use bright colors within the app. Both photography and colors are strong visual elements. There was a danger that they would overpower each other. We needed to find an effective way to combine both photography and color, A brilliant solution was found fairly quickly. We decided to use very bright colors against beautiful black and white photography. The choice of colors wasn’t accidental and was based on the psychology of colors.</p>

            <h2> OUR SOLUTION</h2>
            <p>What we created as a result was a <strong>beautiful, inspiring, simple</strong> and <strong>easy</strong> to use product</p>
            <p>The user is able to customize their motivational calendars with colors and images that they find inspiring and that are suitable to the nature of their individual end goals. The choice of colors contributed to making our motivational calendar even more encouraging.</p>
            <p>The backgrounds that can be added to calendars establish the emotional connection and help achieve the ultimate goal of the application - help users stay focused, determined and productive.</p>
            <p>We made it a point to make the user experience of the application as simple and intuitive as possible without any features that would distract the user from achieving their goals... </p>
