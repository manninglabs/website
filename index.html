    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p class="intro">Please, take a look at some questions that our clients frequently ask. They will give you an idea of how we think, work
      and collaborate with you and each other.</p>
    <div class="accordeon">
      <h3>WHAT KIND OF CLIENTS DO USUALLY YOU WORK WITH?</h3>
      <p>We have vast experience with working with all kinds of clients. We have designed and developed for large international
        corporations, medium-size companies, startups as well as successful individuals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordeon" id="our-process">
      <h3>WHAT IS YOUR PROCESS LIKE?</h3>
      <p>As a team, we found the following process guarantees a successful outcome:
        <br /> 1. We start off any project with
        <strong>an initial face to face meeting</strong> with a client. At that meeting, we mostly listen to what the needs and expectation
        for the project are. We ask questions and try to learn as much as possible about the project and the client.
        <br /> 2. After we feel like we have learnt enough, we sit down together as a team and
        <strong>discuss and evaluate</strong> in detail the project’s goals, the clients expectations, time and budget necessary.
        We find it extremely important to make sure everyone involved in the design/development process is on the same page
        and there are no unexpected surprises for us or the client.
        <br /> 3. We come up with a
        <strong>detailed proposal</strong> that includes the project goals, our suggested solutions, pricing information, milestones
        and deadlines. The proposal is presented and further discussed with the client to make sure both we and the client
        are happy with it.
        <br /> 4. We start the design process by doing a lot (!) of
        <strong>research</strong>. We look for and collect as much information as possible about the potential users, their wants
        and needs as well as the client’s competition. We eliminate guesswork from our process and only make informed decisions
        when it comes to coming up with design solutions.
        <br /> 5. The next step is for our designers to sketch as many ideas and solutions as possible. These
        <strong>brainstorming/ideation</strong> sessions proved to be extremely effective and usually let us narrow it down to the
        best possible solutions.
        <br /> 6. The results of the sketching sessions are presented to the client and potential users in a form of
        <strong>digital wireframes</strong>. We always try to save our clients’ time and money by making sure we get feedback early
        on in the process.
        <br /> 7. Only after the wireframes have been discussed and approved we will go on to designing actual
        <strong>mockups</strong>. We will design two to three different versions of the product.
        <br /> 8. The designed versions are
        <strong>presented and discussed</strong> with the client and potential users.
        <br /> 9. The preferred version is then
        <strong>tweaked and perfected</strong> according to the received feedback.
        <br /> NOTE: Our standard proposal includes repeating steps 8 and 9 up to three times. 10. Depending on how complex the
        project is, our team may choose to create an
        <strong>interactive prototype</strong> of the project to conduct the final testing of the experience and make sure all the
        interactions make sense.
        <br /> 11. The prototype is then
        <strong>presented to the client and potential users</strong> and final tweaks are done to the design and the experience (if
        necessary).
        <br /> 12. If the project requires
        <strong>frontend development</strong>, this is the time when our development team takes over. Our designers will stay active
        participants of the process and oversee the development every step of the way to make sure the final product looks
        pixel-perfect and works properly.
        <br /> 13. The final product is carefully
        <strong>tested</strong> by our team and the potential users.
        <br /> 14. The final product is now presented to the client for
        <strong>final review and sign off</strong>.</p>

    <div class="accordeon">
      <h3>HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE A PROJECT IS SUCCESSFUL?</h3>
      <p>Our team places great emphasis on communication, collaboration and user feedback. That means: effective
        <strong>communication with our clients</strong> every step of the way, close
        <strong>collaboration of designers and developers</strong> to make sure that everyone is always on the same page and getting
        constant
        <strong>feedback from potential users</strong>. We also found that the initial meeting with the client is extremely important.
        We encourage our clients to involve all the main stakeholders of the project in the kick-off meeting. Each of them
        may have different expectations and goals. Our task is to listen to all of them carefully and come up with a perfect
        design solution that will satisfy all the project goals (including the users’ goals!)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordeon">
      <h3>HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE A PROJECT IS ON TIME AND WITHIN BUDGET?</h3>
      <p>Before we even start working on a project we meet with a client and discuss all the possible wants, needs and expectations.
        We then evaluate the complexity of the project and come up with a detailed proposal that includes the budget, milestones
        and the deadlines. By the time we are ready to start working, both our team and the client have a clear idea of what
        needs to be done when. We strive to meet all our deadlines and never to go over the estimated budget.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordeon">
      <h3>HOW OFTEN DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH A CLIENT?</h3>
      <p>As long as the client has availability, we try to be constantly in touch! In our experience, frequent effective communication
        with the client and receiving regular feedback can ensure the success and timely completion of any project.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordeon">
      <h3>HOW MANY DESIGN ROUNDS DO YOU OFFER?</h3>
      <p>We include three rounds of review and redesign in our proposal. That is usually enough to make sure both our creative
        team and most importantly the client are fully satisfied with the product. Although, if our client feels like another
        round or two is needed - we are always open to discussing how we can work things out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordeon">
      <h3>I ALREADY HAVE A WEBSITE. WHAT IS YOUR APPROACH TO DESIGN FACELIFTS AND REDESIGNS?</h3>
      <p>The approach would not be much different from what we usually do. We will have a detailed initial interview with the
        client to find our their goals, needs and expectations. We will also test the existing product and find all the pain
        points that may need to be addressed. We will do careful competition research and conduct user interviews. The information
        we receive from all of the above will help us come up with an ideal solution for the re-design. (

    </div>
    <div class="accordeon">
      <h3>I HAVE AN IDEA BUT NOT SURE HOW IT SHOULD WORK. DO YOU OFFER HELP WITH CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. About 50% of the projects we work on are just ideas that our clients have. Our creative team has great
        expertise in concept development. By means of extensive research, user interviews and brainstorming sessions we will
        bring your idea to life, no matter how complex the experience may seem.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="accordeon">
      <h3>WHAT IS YOUR APPROACH TO PRICING PROJECTS?</h3>
      <p>Since the complexity of design and development varies greatly from project to project, our prices differ too. After
        the initial meeting, we carefully evaluate your project and come up with a detailed proposal that we then explain
        and discuss with you. We always work with our clients to determine the fairest possible price.</p>
